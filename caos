Hi Louis,
I would just continue to call the teams Caos and Afouteza.They would effectively be an A and B team or since our players are not playing high school soccer but are all in High School they are effectively exactly how a school would split a Varsity and Junior Varsity.
First this is what we have as far as I know:2006: Erion Dede ** special case
2005:TediLukeEricDannyDominic
2004:NachoArberAkmalCarlos 
JeremyVictorJosh
Nick


2003:Daniel DedeCameronEsvinFabioJulianLewisMateus
2002Valentino
This is only a total of 21 players so it is why as a club we needed to be building from the top down. The top of the club is what informs all the rosters and age groups entered because you cannot play down in soccer only up.
We actually may need unless we get more players to move possibly players like Artur up to play with Caos.
