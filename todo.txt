--users
are jbreslin33 which then branches to me giving invite to momom or colleen as guardians

underneath as well are user_members like netflix model
this table contains bio information and ...
can even contain email and password for a seperate login
the advantage of seperate login is it bypasses having to click luke and still keeps relation to user.

--signup
you get an email from admin 
it has link  to signup to cmswebapp with a code attached that will get you in as user  

once you are a user you may add site_members that belong to you

user--jbreslin33

site_members--Luke Breslin, 


the only person that can add players, managers or coaches to a team is manager or admin. 
anyone can jump in as a parent????
anyone can be a club member....


--users
anyone can be a user just sign up on the site like facebook or twitter or gmail
this will in cases be a parent whos email will be username and the kids and possibly the spouse will use it.

-- a site member 
is anyone who will be on the site of importance to the club
so a player, parent, coach, manager but it's possible that a grandparent or spouse is just using the user persona of parent and is a ghost and that is ok we dont need their info

--Handling sibling to sibling
luke would have a checkbox to see grace schedule or not 


---------------------------------
How do I handle emails? First email contact will be with parent-- will that hold significance and be primary or do we treat everyone as separate entitites?
What about netflix model with one email and multiple accounts? Could we then still branch out from with some having ind
idiot we are going to join the players and managers table but what if your both????? 

def think need to split up practice and meeting and game atleast game as it has another field called opponent etc and a meeting will not have sessions and :wq

/*
codes
---------------
100 success
101 please provide a username and a password  
102 please provide a username  
103 please provide a password  
104 user does not exist
105 wrong password

300 return schedule 
301 some other report


everything else will be done on client

So views should only need email address
only updates and inserts should check for password

so for a query all i need is a saved username which will be an email address if I have that 
there is no reason for user to login. if however they try to update or insert i will check but that will be in update and insert class to be made later.
so this class just needs to parse username and some parameters and a code.

LOOKING AROUND
touch screen or click to simulate looking around
-------------------------------------------
roles issue

should we have a player/parent button(default) 
manager button, coach button, director button
this way if you are a player/parent you are automagically taken to that screen.

It's like an area.  ....also if you are not even listed in db as coach dont really then need to have that button OR could just check when you click it and then bounce you back.

so after you click an area you may or may not be asked to select a team......depends on context

players/parents can do player parent things in that area:
view schedule --schedule will have link to session plan by coach
update availability
make payments
view macro/meso/micro cycles 

managers can:
view schedule
insert/update schedule

coaches can:
view schedule
insert/update session plans
interact with other coaches and see their sessions.
 So going to start the above changes so login will be simpler
Here is old login sql that will be used possibly later:
                $query = "select users.id, users.password, users_clubs_roles.club_id, users_clubs_roles.roles_id, users_clubs_roles_teams.team_id, users_clubs_roles_teams.default_timestamp
                        from users
                        full outer join users_clubs_roles on users_clubs_roles.users_id=users.id
                        join users_clubs_roles_teams on users_clubs_roles_teams.users_clubs_roles_id=users_clubs_roles.id
                        where users.username = '";
                        $query .= $this->mUsername;
                        $query .= "' order by users_clubs_roles_teams.default_timestamp desc LIMIT 1;";

Also right now I will have you login with username and passsword but will have quick check option for view only if you only know your username!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTAnT
